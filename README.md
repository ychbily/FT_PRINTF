# FT_PRINTF - Custom Printf Function

## Overview

FT_PRINTF is a custom implementation of the printf function in C. It allows formatting and printing of data to the standard output according to a format string. This project was developed as part of the 42 curriculum, aiming to deepen understanding of variadic functions, parsing, and string manipulation in C programming.

## Features

- **Format Specifiers:** Supports the common format specifiers used in the printf function, such as `%s`, `%d`, `%c`, `%x`, `%p`, and more.
- **Variadic Function:** Utilizes variadic function syntax to handle a variable number of arguments.
- **Customizable:** Allows for customization and extension to support additional format specifiers or functionality.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ychbily/FT_PRINTF.git

2. Compile the project:

make

3. Include the header file ft_printf.h in your C source files:

#include "ft_printf.h"

4. Use the ft_printf function to format and print data:

ft_printf("Hello, %s!\n", "world");
```
